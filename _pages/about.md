My work and research focus on making ML usable for practitioners, especially in the field of Biology. In my current role as a Ph.D. candidate, I utilize CNNs and other ML-based approaches to address limitations in widely used fluorescence microscopy. Some of my work includes:

* [aisegcell](https://github.com/CSDGroup/aisegcell): An implementation of [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) to segment cell nuclei in transmitted light microscopy images.
* [napari-aisegcell](https://github.com/CSDGroup/napari-aisegcell): A graphical user interface for the aisegcell package available via [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).
* [model-runner](https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/model-runner): CLI to submit a hyper-parameter optimization
  (i.e. grid search) via [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0) or [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com)
* [torch-model-zoo](https://github.com/dsethz/torch-model-zoo): A (soon to be) collection of PyTorch models
  (incl. Vanilla ViT).
