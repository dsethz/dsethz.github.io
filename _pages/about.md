My work and research focus on making ML usable for practitioners, especially in the field of Biology. In my current role as a Ph.D. candidate, I utilize AI/ML to address limitations in widely used fluorescence microscopy. Some of my work includes:

* [aisegcell](https://github.com/CSDGroup/aisegcell): A deep learning-based image segmentation CLI that includes pretrained models for cell nucleus segmentations in bright field microscopy images.
* [napari-aisegcell](https://github.com/CSDGroup/napari-aisegcell): A GUI for the [aisegcell](https://github.com/CSDGroup/aisegcell) package to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images.
* [model-runner](https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/model-runner): CLI to validate and submit hyperparameter optimization jobs on a slurm/lsf cluster.
* [nuclai](https://github.com/dsethz/nuclai): A deep learning-based CLI for image representation learning and
  image classification of 3D nucleus images (work in progress).
